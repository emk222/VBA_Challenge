Sub Macro3_Close_Price()

   ' I approached the homework as a series of Steps.  Macros 1 through 3 identify the data for each ticker; Macro 4 makes calculations on that data; Macro 5 formats; Macro 6 completes the challenge exercise;  Macro 7 nests Macros 1-6 to be performed on one worksheet; Macro  8 executes Macro 7 across all worksheets.  With all macros in place running Macro 8 executes all the activity. 

  'Identify the close price 
  ' Set an initial variable for holding the ticker name
  Dim Ticker_Name As String

  ' Set an initial variable for holding the total per ticker
  Dim Close_Price As Double
  Close_Price = 0

  ' Keep track of the location for each ticker in the summary table
  Dim Summary_Table_Row As Integer
  Summary_Table_Row = 2

  ' Determine the Last Row
   Dim lastrow As Long
   lastrow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row

  ' Loop through all
  For i = 2 To lastrow


    ' Check if we are still within the same ticker, if it is not...
    If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then

      ' Set the Ticker_Name
      Ticker_Name = Cells(i, 1).Value

      ' State the Close Price
      Close_Price = Cells(i, 6).Value

      ' Print the Ticker Name in the Summary Table
      Range("K" & Summary_Table_Row).Value = Ticker_Name

      ' Print the Cose Price to the Summary Table
      Range("P" & Summary_Table_Row).Value = Close_Price

      ' Add one to the summary table row
      Summary_Table_Row = Summary_Table_Row + 1
      
      ' Reset the Brand Total
      Brand_Total = 0

    ' If the cell immediately following a row is the same brand...
