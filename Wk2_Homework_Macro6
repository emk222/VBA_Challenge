Sub Macro6_Challenge()
 
 ' I approached the homework as a series of Steps.  Macros 1 through 3 identify the data for each ticker; Macro 4 makes calculations on that data; Macro 5 formats; Macro 6 completes the challenge exercise;  Macro 7 nests Macros 1-6 to be performed on one worksheet; Macro  8 executes Macro 7 across all worksheets.  With all macros in place running Macro 8 executes all the activity.
